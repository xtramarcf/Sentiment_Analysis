# Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains all scripts of the project. 
But the project also requires some data files, which represents the raw data, the formatted data, the trained models and so on.
The data files needs to be added manually.

For that, please do the following steps:

1. Create a local folder for the Sentiment_Analysis and pull the project to that folder.

2. Download data.zip from the following link: 
   https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x9605m6a7lee7l88zfu8p/data.zip?rlkey=g8tdzd8w4yxoan8vyrrw8tkl4&dl=0

3. You have to unpack the downloaded .zip and copy the data folder into the .zip to the project directory.
   The src-folder of the project and the data-folder need to be in the same directory
   
Now you can open the project in an IDE of your choice.
